# CANRGX-Embedded

## CANTest
Blank CubeMX project to illustrate pin assignments as of April 7, 2018

## CANTest0
ADC + serial code running on top of FreeRTOS

## MPUTest
Began just as MPU9250 code running on top of FreeRTOS, and has now evolved into the final program

## PC-Side
Real-time GUI which plots sensor data and displays the controller state. The GUI also features manual override buttons for starting and stopping experiments, and in extreme cases resetting the microcontroller

## PastFlightData
Some raw acceleration data and the corresponding plots from past flights

## Doc
Various documentation, including an interactive HTML for the embedded program (generated using Doxygen), circuit schematics for the electrical systems, and a few other tidbits
